## 🩺 Problem Statement

Mouth ulcers are often ignored, but some types can develop into **oral cancer** if not detected and treated early. In many rural and underserved regions, lack of access to diagnosis tools leads to late detection and poor outcomes.

## 🎯 Our Solution

OroLight is a compact diagnostic kit that uses **image processing, hardware sensors, and a trained ML model** to identify the stage of oral ulcers and classify whether they are:
- Benign
- Pre-cancerous
- Cancer-risk

## 🔬 Features

- 📷 Optical scanning of the mouth region
- 🧠 Stage prediction using a trained ML/AI model
- 🪶 Lightweight and USB-operated hardware
- 📱 Companion web interface for real-time results display

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Hardware:
- Camera module  
- LED Light for illumination  
- Motor with medicine container  
- 3D-printed or acrylic casing  

### Software:
- Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Flask backend (API for prediction)
- Web interface: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Place the OroLight device near the patient’s mouth
2. Capture a high-quality image using the integrated camera
3. Process the image to extract ulcer characteristics using OpenCV
4. Feed the processed image to a pre-trained ML model
5. Predict the stage and display the result on a connected web interface

**An affordable, AI-powered device for the early detection of oral cancer.**

OroLight is a portable diagnostic tool designed to analyze mouth ulcers and assess their potential to progress into cancerous stages. By combining hardware, computer vision, and machine learning, we aim to make early detection accessible and reliable, especially in low-resource settings.

## The Challenge

The silent progression of mouth ulcers into **oral cancer** is a critical health issue, particularly in underserved regions. Late detection, often due to a lack of accessible diagnostic tools, dramatically reduces patient survival rates. A gap exists for a low-cost, easy-to-use tool that can provide immediate, preliminary diagnosis.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

OroLight bridges this gap with a compact, intelligent kit that analyzes oral lesions. Using a high-resolution camera and a custom-trained machine learning model, the device classifies ulcers into one of three categories, providing crucial information for follow-up care:
- **Benign:** Non-threatening ulcers.
- **Pre-Cancerous:** Lesions with potential to become malignant.
- **High-Risk/Cancerous:** Ulcers requiring immediate medical attention.

## üìã Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Portable Diagnostics** | A lightweight, USB-powered design makes it perfect for use in clinics or mobile health camps. |
| **AI-Powered Analysis** | Utilizes a trained Machine Learning model to analyze ulcer images and predict their malignancy risk in real-time. |
| **Instant Feedback** | A companion web interface displays diagnostic results immediately, aiding quick decision-making for healthcare workers. |
| **Integrated Illumination** | Built-in LED provides consistent, high-quality lighting for accurate and reliable image capture. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The diagnostic process is designed to be simple and fast:

1.  **üì∏ Capture:** The device is placed near the patient's mouth, and a high-resolution image of the ulcer is captured.
2.  **‚öôÔ∏è Process:** The image is automatically processed using **OpenCV** to enhance features and isolate the region of interest.
3.  **üß† Analyze:** The processed image is fed into our pre-trained **ML model** to determine the ulcer's characteristics and stage.
4.  **üìä Display:** The prediction result (**Benign**, **Pre-Cancerous**, or **High-Risk**) is instantly sent to and displayed on the connected web interface.
